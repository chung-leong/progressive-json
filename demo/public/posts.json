Now, led by Uriridiakoghene \u201cUlili\u201d Onovakpuri and Brian Dixon, Kapor Capital is hoping to raise a $50 million opportunity fund, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1963174\/000196317423000001\/xslFormDX01\/primary_doc.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to an SEC filing.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The opportunity fund, if closed, would continue Kapor Capital\u2019s new strategy of taking capital from outside investors. Up until last year, all of Kapor\u2019s funds were directly from the founding partners; in September, though, the firm closed a $126 million Fund 3 backed by investors including Cambridge Associates, Align Impact, Ford Foundation, Bank of America, PayPal and Twilio.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, Dixon told TechCrunch that turning to external investors helps the firm with access; Kapor is now writing checks between $250,000 and $3 million with a primary focus on participating in pre-seed and seed rounds. Onovakpuri said the larger fund would allow them to invest in more companies with bigger checks.<\/p>\n<p>That said, with presumably a fresh chunk of capital to deploy, why would Kapor be eyeing an opportunity fund? It\u2019s a trend-turned-standard among early-stage venture capital firms that want to get in on later rounds of their star portfolio companies.

I am deeply appreciative of the jury\u2019s unanimous finding of innocence in the Tesla 420 take-private case.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The central question in the lawsuit was whether Musk was liable for losses suffered by shareholders after he posted in August 2018 several messages on Twitter that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. Musk <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ranimolla\/status\/1026873446775644167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">initially tweeted<\/a> &#8220;Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.&#8221; Another pair of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1026914941004001280?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweets soon<\/a> followed: &#8220;Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it\u2019s contingent on a shareholder vote&#8221; and then another stating that he doesn\u2019t have a controlling vote now and \u201cwouldn\u2019t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys representing investors argued that these shareholders suffered financially as a result. Musk, Tesla and its board, faced billions of dollars in damages.<\/p>\n<p>The trial was not to determine whether those tweets were true. That question had already been answered. Edward M. Chen, the federal judge overseeing the case, ruled that the tweets were untrue and Musk was reckless for posting them.<\/p>\n<p>The three-week trial was largely a tug-of-war over language and intent.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Attorney Nicholas Porritt, who made closing arguments for the plaintiffs, argued that when Musk posted the tweets the company was nowhere near reaching a deal to go private, citing emails and texts to prove there was not an agreement or even a framework to reach one.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To Elon Musk, if he believes it even just thinks about it, then it&#8217;s true no matter how objectively false or exaggerated it may be,&#8221; Porritt said. &#8220;That may work in his businesses. That&#8217;s not an issue for this trial. But it does not work in securities markets or public companies. Securities markets have rules governing what you can and cannot say. And one of those basic rules is that what you say must be true and accurate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alex Spiro, who represented Musk, countered, stating throughout his closing arguments that funding was not the issue at all and Musk knew he could attain it if needed. Instead, Spiro <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/blog\/staying-public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed to a blog post<\/a> several weeks after Musk&#8217;s tweets explaining that Musk would not take Tesla private because existing shareholders believed it was better off as a publicly traded company.<\/p>\n<p>While Musk avoided a hefty bill in damages, the funding secured tweet has cost him.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in September 2018 alleging Musk lied when he tweeted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a private takeover of the company at $420 per share. The complaint was filed after Musk and Tesla\u2019s board abruptly walked away from an agreement with the SEC. The board not only pulled out of the agreement, it issued a bold statement of support for Musk after the charges were filed.<\/p>\n<p>A settlement was eventually reached anyway, albeit with stiffer penalties than the original agreement. Musk agreed, in the settlement reached on September 29, to step down as chairman of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine. Tesla agreed to pay a separate $20 million penalty.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Elon Musk was found not liable in a class-action securities fraud trial that centered on the Tesla CEO&#8217;s now infamous &#8220;funding secured&#8221; tweet.

Employed by Alphabet subcontractor Cognizant, the striking workers allege that both companies&#8217; management have leveraged unfair labor practices to get in the way of their union drive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, the vast majority of our department is ready to vote yes in a [National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)] election,&#8221; said YouTube Music generalist Sam Regan at a strike in Austin, Texas, viewed via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlphabetWorkers\/videos\/917192873060803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook livestream<\/a>. &#8220;In an act of retaliation against our organizing efforts, our employer is forcing an end to remote work before the vote, which would dramatically interfere with the fair voting conditions mandated by federal law.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>YouTube Music&#8217;s content operations team is expected to return to the Austin office on Monday. But according to the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), the majority of workers were hired remotely, and almost one quarter are not even based in Texas.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Workers are paid as little as $19 dollars an hour and thus, cannot afford the relocation, travel or childcare costs associated with in person work,&#8221; the AWU said in a press release.<\/p>\n<p>On January 23, the AWU &#8212; affiliated with the Communications Workers of America &#8212; filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB.

Instead of making an alt account to privately reach the people you trust, you can add them to your Circle. When someone posts to their Circle (and you&#8217;ve been added to that group), you can see a green banner beneath their tweets, indicating that it&#8217;s a Circle tweet. Now, many users&#8217; tweets are no longer appearing with that green banner, sparking some moments of panic that you accidentally tweeted to your entire following something intended for your friends.<\/p>\n<p>We have observed that the green banner rarely appears when we see other users&#8217; Circle tweets. Instead, you can tell that a post was sent to the Circle because it becomes unable to be retweeted. If the user is already private, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a distinction. If you try to retweet these posts, a somewhat broken notice will arise, saying that &#8220;only (null) and their Twitter Circle can see these Tweets,&#8221; failing to populate the user&#8217;s name.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Some users have tweeted that their Circle tweets have been posted publicly, although TechCrunch has not been able to confirm this behavior. Whether tweets are actually seen beyond their intended audience or not, the confusion is enough to undermine the privacy-focused feature.<\/p>\n<p>Some people have tweeted warnings to their followers that they should be careful with what they post on Circle, since it may not be as private as they think. Others have said that that they&#8217;re operating under the assumption that their DMs may become public one day and no users should have the expectation of privacy on Twitter at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it poses a real privacy concern if users cannot fully control who their audience is. Yoel Roth, Twitter&#8217;s former head of trust and safety, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/06\/twitters-ios-app-is-riddled-with-privacy-settings-glitches\/\">warned us<\/a> after he resigned that &#8220;If protected tweets stop working, run, because that\u2019s a symptom that something is deeply wrong.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We might not quite be there yet, but there&#8217;s definitely reason to be concerned if Twitter Circle is glitching like this.<\/p>\n<p>The saying goes, &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221; To those who remain on Twitter staff, I implore you: If it ain&#8217;t broke, please just don&#8217;t touch it, because it will almost definitely crumble before our very eyes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MoAe68nTvk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/twitter-to-end-free-access-to-its-api\/\">Twitter to end free access to its API in Elon Musk&#8217;s latest monetization push<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter to end free access to its API in Elon Musk&#8217;s latest monetization push&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/twitter-to-end-free-access-to-its-api\/embed\/#?secret=BRg7zBxDc7#?secret=MoAe68nTvk\" data-secret=\"MoAe68nTvk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5P5FgiXzyx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/06\/twitters-ios-app-is-riddled-with-privacy-settings-glitches\/\">Twitter&#8217;s iOS app is riddled with privacy settings glitches<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s iOS app is riddled with privacy settings glitches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/06\/twitters-ios-app-is-riddled-with-privacy-settings-glitches\/embed\/#?secret=yhyjU4VxQk#?secret=5P5FgiXzyx\" data-secret=\"5P5FgiXzyx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As more Twitter features break and glitch, users are becoming increasingly concerned about the platform&#8217;s stability.

The company introduced a handful of features in recent years to help content creators earn money, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/twitter-super-follows-monetization\/\">Super Follows<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces\/\">Ticketed Spaces<\/a> and a special <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/twitter-rolls-out-a-new-tool-for-creators-to-manage-their-earnings-on-the-platform\/\">monetization dashboard<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s creator features emphasize connecting creators and their followers directly with monthly paid subscriptions and ticketing, but Musk is apparently interested in adding an advertising revenue share into the mix.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>YouTube has long split revenue with its creator community and is generally regarded as the best place to reliably make money from videos. The company pays out 55% of revenue earned through on-channel ads and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/09\/youtube-new-partner-program-terms-shorts-revenue-sharing-february-1\/\">recently introduced<\/a> revenue sharing for its short form TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts.<\/p>\n<p>Other companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/meta-s-resistance-to-sharing-ad-sales-starts-to-crumble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most notably Meta<\/a>, have been slow to adopt this monetization model. TikTok only announced its own ad revenue sharing program mid last year <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/tiktok-introduces-its-first-ad-product-to-offer-a-revenue-share-with-creators\/\">with TikTok Pulse<\/a>, though the offer was only extended to accounts with at least 100,000 followers \u2014 a lofty cutoff. The ad revenue sharing model is even less common on platforms that emphasize text rather than video.<\/p>\n<p>Recent tweets suggest that Musk wants to position Twitter as a creator haven that can compete with YouTube, but the platform has far less of a foothold in video and it&#8217;s far from clear that the company can build out resource-intensive video features while the platform&#8217;s most basic functions are already deteriorating.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Let\u2019s see what happens when Twitter offers good video with higher compensation for creators,&#8221; Musk wrote in a reply to MrBeast, YouTube&#8217;s most-followed user.<\/p>\n<p>This week alone, many Twitter users flipped their accounts to private after anecdotal reports suggested that some people were seeing less engagement following changes to the recommendation algorithm. Other bugs, like retweets incorrectly displaying as deleted, have been popping up regularly and mostly lingering.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also not clear that Twitter actually has the means to begin sharing its ad revenue with creators. That change would present an entirely new monetization option, presumably one that requires quite a bit of building on the back end to track, calculate and pay out a user&#8217;s cut of the ad revenue from their reply threads. To date, Twitter&#8217;s monetization options for creators have stuck to relatively simple direct payments for tickets and subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve yet to witness any evidence that this ad revenue sharing program is active in the wild on Twitter, but we&#8217;ll be tracking the changes, how they impact creators and what comes of Musk&#8217;s quixotic plans to flip Twitter into a YouTube competitor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter&#8217;s new owner is making moves to build in more revenue streams for creators \u2014 or at least he&#8217;s tweeting about it.

The company\u2019s Q4 2022 results were highly anticipated as investors and the tech industry awaited Google\u2019s response to the popularity of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which has the potential to threaten its core business.<\/p>\n<p>During the call, <a href=\"https:\/\/abc.xyz\/investor\/static\/pdf\/2022_Q4_Earnings_Transcript.pdf?cache=c632791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked<\/a> about the company\u2019s plans to make AI-based large language models (LLMs) like LaMDA available in the coming weeks and months. Pichai said users will soon be able to use large language models as a companion to search. An LLM, like ChatGPT, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize and generate text and other content based on knowledge from enormous amounts of text data. Pichai said the models that users will soon be able to use are particularly good for composing, constructing and summarizing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow that we can integrate more direct LLM-type experiences in Search, I think it will help us expand and serve new types of use cases, generative use cases,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cAnd so, I think I see this as a chance to rethink and reimagine and drive Search to solve more use cases for our users as well. It\u2019s early days, but you will see us be bold, put things out, get feedback and iterate and make things better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pichai\u2019s comments about the possible ChatGPT rival come as a report revealed this week that Microsoft is working to incorporate a faster version of ChatGPT, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/report-microsoft-plans-to-update-bing-with-a-faster-version-of-chatgpt-in-the-coming-weeks\/\">known as GPT-4, into Bing<\/a>, in a move that would make its search engine, which today has only a sliver of search market share, more competitive with Google. The popularity of ChatGPT has seen Google reportedly turning to co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin for help in combating the potential threat. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/01\/20\/technology\/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times<\/a> recently reported that Page and Brin had several meetings with executives to strategize about the company\u2019s AI plans.<\/p>\n<p>During the call, Pichai warned investors and analysts that the technology will need to scale slowly and that he sees large language usage as still being in its \u201cearly days.\u201d He also said that the company is developing AI with a deep sense of responsibility and that it\u2019s going to be careful when launching AI-based products, as the company plans to initially launch beta features and then slowly scale up from there.<\/p>\n<p>He went on to note that Google will provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators and partners to empower them to build their own applications and discover new possibilities with AI.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Google announced that starting in the first quarter of 2023, the company is going to change its reporting structure for its DeepMind AI segment. The segment will now be reported as part of Alphabet\u2019s corporate costs, as opposed to being reported in the Other Bets umbrella, which includes long-payoff projects. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the reporting change \u201creflects the strategic focus in DeepMind to support each one of our segments.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The move is also meant to signal to the industry that the company is serious about investing in the advancing space of AI.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the call, the tech giant revealed that it is holding a Search and AI event on February 8. The aim of the event is to show how Google is \u201cusing the power of AI to reimagine how people search for, explore and interact with information, making it more natural and intuitive than ever before to find what you need,\u201d according to an invite sent to reporters. The invitation also includes hints about Google Maps, Lens, Shopping and Translate.<\/p>\n<p>Google typically shares updates about Maps, Lens and other similar products during its I\/O conference in May, which makes this new surprise event interesting. Because it&#8217;s taking place in a few days, it appears that Google is focused on addressing threats to its core business and reassuring investors it\u2019s still an \u201cAI-first\u201d company.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAI is the most profound technology we are working on today,\u201d Pichai said during the call. \u201cOur talented researchers, infrastructure and technology make us extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point. More than six years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we have been a leader in developing AI. We are just at the beginning of our AI journey and the best is yet to come,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Another new development showcasing Google\u2019s focus on AI is the news that it\u2019s investing $300 million in AI startup Anthropic. The news was first reported by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/583ead66-467c-4bd5-84d0-ed5df7b5bf9c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Financial Times<\/a> and Google confirmed the investment to TechCrunch on Friday. Anthropic\u2019s recently debuted <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/09\/anthropics-claude-improves-on-chatgpt-but-still-suffers-from-limitations\/\">AI model Claude<\/a> is seen as a rival to ChatGPT. The new funding will value the San Francisco-based company at around $5 billion. The news comes as Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/23\/microsoft-invests-billions-more-dollars-in-openai-extends-partnership\/\">recently announced<\/a> a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the call, Pichai reiterated that Google has been investing in AI for several years now.<\/p>\n<p>Although this is true, the company hasn&#8217;t exactly made many notable strides in the space publicly. For instance, the company has the <a href=\"https:\/\/experiments.withgoogle.com\/playground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI Playground application<\/a>, which had the potential to be like ChatGPT, but was purposely limited. The company also unveiled an AI language model called PaLM, which stands for Pathways Language Model, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/developers\/io-2022-keynote\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at I\/O last year<\/a>. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s largest model to date, but Google has yet to share its plans for the model or how it will be leveraged.<\/p>\n<p>Despite Google&#8217;s assurances, investors are now watching closely to see how the search giant responds to the looming threat posed by ChatGPT. Although shares of Alphabet opened lower today after the company turned in a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report, the company recouped all of its losses by mid-day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google worked to reassure investors and analysts on Thursday during its quarterly earnings call that it\u2019s still a leader in developing AI.

Experts suggest that having so many activist investors in play at once at a major tech company like Salesforce is exceptional.<\/p>\n<p>What do these folks want from Salesforce, which is hardly in full distress? Sure, the stock is down, but Salesforce raked in $8 billion last quarter.<\/p>\n<p>But that could be precisely why the investors are so interested \u2014 because they believe whatever they think is wrong can be fixed fairly quickly, and everyone can make a lot of money without a lot of fuss.<\/p>\n<p>That may or may not be the case. When you have four strong personalities involved in the same game, even if their end goal is in sync, how do you get them all collaborating to pull CEO Marc Benioff and the board of directors in line with them? And let\u2019s not forget that Benioff has a pretty strong personality himself.<\/p>\n<p>If the investors have differing opinions about what\u2019s wrong at Salesforce, it can create an opening for Benioff to negotiate, something that activist investors don\u2019t typically like to do. Instead, they like to dictate terms and position themselves \u2014 usually by capturing board seats \u2014 to make sure the company does what they want. Salesforce did announce <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/30\/board-changes-could-signal-salesforces-willingness-to-appease-activist-investors\/\">three new board members<\/a> last week, including ValueAct CEO and chief investment officer Mason Morfit.<\/p>\n<p>But with four firms, who gets additional board seats? Who negotiates these changes? Do they work together or do they come apart? It\u2019s an interesting exercise in teamwork.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/02\/a-complete-guide-to-the-new-ev-tax-credit\/\">federal EV tax credit<\/a>, including GM&#8217;s Cadillac Lyric, the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla&#8217;s five-seater Model Y, thanks to a change by the U.S. Treasury.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy1245\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Treasury Department<\/a> updated Friday the vehicle classification standard, revising a definition that determines which EVs are eligible for clean vehicle tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act. The change, which automakers had lobbied the Biden administration for, comes down to one question: what makes a vehicle a sedan, SUV, crossover or wagon?<\/p>\n<p>That classification matters, because the federal tax credit had two different prices caps. A car, sedan or wagon would qualify if priced at $55,000 or below, while an SUV had an $80,000 price cap.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law in August 2022, includes a complex set of requirements around which EVs and other clean vehicles <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/16\/biden-admin-says-about-20-models-will-still-qualify-for-ev-tax-credits\/\">do and do not qualify for a $7,500 EV tax credit<\/a>. The IRA amended the Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit (also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/plug-in-electric-vehicle-credit-irc-30-and-irc-30d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IRC 30D<\/a>), which gave consumers up to $7,500 in tax credits for buying a battery electric vehicle and certain plug-in hybrid vehicles. This reworked law, now called the Clean Vehicle Credit, includes a reduced $4,000 credit for used EVs and adds other clean vehicles in the mix, such as \u201cqualified fuel cell vehicles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Qualifying for the tax credit is another matter. There are a number of factors that determine if a vehicle will qualify for the EV tax credits, including the buyer&#8217;s income, the price of the vehicle and where it was assembled. Under the new law, battery electric SUVs had to be $80,000 or cheaper and sedans.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Treasury said it updated the standard to make it easier for consumers to know which vehicles qualify under the applicable price cap. The agency will now use the EPA Fuel Economy Labeling standard rather than the EPA CAFE standard. That matters because it means crossover vehicles that share similar features will be treated consistently. It will also align vehicle classifications under the clean vehicle credit with the classification displayed on the vehicle label and on the consumer-facing website <a href=\"https:\/\/fueleconomy.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FuelEconomy.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The upshot? Vehicle models like the Cadillac Lyric, which starts at $62,990, as well as the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which depending on the trims is priced between $45,995 and $63,995, now qualify for the $7,500 EV tax credit. Other vehicles that now qualify includes the five-seater Tesla Model Y.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few more electric vehicle models now qualify for the federal EV tax credit, including GM&#8217;s Cadillac Lyric, the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Tesla&#8217;s five-seater Model Y, thanks to a change by the U.S. Treasury.

But perhaps even more troubling, the company reported in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2023\/02\/02\/amazoncom-amzn-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earnings call with analysts<\/a> that growth dropped even further into the mid-teens for the first month of the new year, as the cloud continued a general slowdown with customers looking for ways to slash bills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens,\u201d CFO Brian Olsavsky said in his comments to open the call.<\/p>\n<p>For a division that has enjoyed high growth rates for years, mid-teens growth represents an extraordinary drop, and it didn\u2019t go unnoticed during the earnings call. Analysts were certainly curious whether it was a longer-term trend, but Olsavsky really wasn\u2019t ready to predict beyond this quarter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo on the AWS growth rate, I&#8217;m not sure I can forecast for you with any level of certainty what is going to happen beyond this quarter. This is a bit of uncharted territory economically. And as we mentioned, there&#8217;s some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that Olsavsky also reported an annual revenue run rate of $85 billion, suggesting that AWS remains an extremely healthy business in spite of the economic headwinds it\u2019s facing. \u201cThat said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who spent a good part of his career at the company running AWS, says that as customers look to cut costs, there will be a short-term growth deceleration, but still sees plenty of cloud market to conquer post downturn.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I think it&#8217;s also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip. I don&#8217;t think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud&#8230;It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business,\u201d he said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Perhaps, but for a business that has been a growth engine for the company for many years, the current slow-down at AWS still has to be worrying.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday Amazon reported earnings, with AWS growing a modest 20% for the quarter over the prior year to $21 billion.

The rules would govern AI applications based on their perceived risks, and would effectively be the first AI-centric laws introduced by any major regulatory body.<\/p>\n<p>The European Parliament is set to vote on a draft version of the AI Act in the coming months, and depending on what discussions and debates follow, it could be adopted by the end of 2023.<\/p>\n<h2>Open source + AI<\/h2>\n<p>As many will know, open source and AI are intrinsically linked, given that collaboration and shared data are pivotal to developing AI systems. As well-meaning as the AI Act might be, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/06\/the-eus-ai-act-could-have-a-chilling-effect-on-open-source-efforts-experts-warn\/\">critics argue that it could have significant unintended consequences<\/a> for the open source community, which in turn could hamper the progress of AI. The crux of the problem is that the Act would likely create legal liability for general purpose AI systems (GPAI), and bestow more power and control to the big tech firms given that independent open source developers don&#8217;t have the resources to contend with legal wrangles.<\/p>\n<p>So, why would GitHub &#8212; a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/04\/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock\/\">$7.5 billion U.S. company owned by Microsoft<\/a> &#8212; be concerned about regulations on the other side of the pond? There are multiple reasons. Open source software by its very nature is distributed, and GitHub &#8212; which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/26\/github-says-it-now-has-100m-active-users\/\">recently passed 100 million users<\/a> &#8212; relies on developers globally. Indeed, a report from VC firm Runa Capital this week <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/which-open-source-startups-rocketed-in-2022\/\">indicated that 58% of the fastest-growing open source startups<\/a> are based outside the U.S., with Germany, France and the U.K. (though it isn&#8217;t governed by EU regulations) in particular central to this.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that Europe has emerged as a driving force behind tech regulations, evidenced by its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/20\/wtf-is-gdpr\/\">GDPR data privacy and protection regulations<\/a>. Put simply, what happens in Europe can ripple into other countries and quickly become a global standard.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The AI act is so crucial,&#8221; Dohmke said onstage. &#8220;This policy could well set the precedent for how the world regulates AI. It is foundationally important. It is important for European technological leadership, and for the future of the European economy itself. It must be fair and balanced to the open source community.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Big bucks<\/h2>\n<p>Microsoft and GitHub stand to benefit from a fertile open source landscape, evidenced by their <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/08\/github-launches-copilot-for-business-plan-as-legal-questions-remain-unresolved\/\">potentially lucrative Copilot tool<\/a> that helps developers code using technology trained on the work of open source developers. Microsoft, GitHub and AI research lab OpenAI, in which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/23\/microsoft-invests-billions-more-dollars-in-openai-extends-partnership\/\">Microsoft is heavily invested<\/a>, are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/11\/8\/23446821\/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">facing a class action lawsuit<\/a> for their endeavors.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, OpenAI&#8217;s much-hyped text-generating <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/openai-launches-chatgpt-plus-starting-at-20-per-month\/\">AI phenomenon ChatGPT<\/a> is also in the spotlight, with the EU&#8217;s Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton noting in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/eus-breton-warns-chatgpt-risks-ai-rules-seek-tackle-concerns-2023-02-03\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview with Reuters<\/a> today that ChatGPT&#8217;s transformative and wide-reaching applications underscores the need for robust regulation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As showcased by ChatGPT, AI solutions can offer great opportunities for businesses and citizens, but can also pose risks,&#8221; Breton told Reuters. &#8220;This is why we need a solid regulatory framework to ensure trustworthy AI based on high-quality data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pretty much the entire world of AI as we know it today has been built on an open source foundation, and anyone with an interest in commercializing AI needs the open source status quo to continue. The big tech firms, including Microsoft, recognize that they might have more legal battles on their hands as a result of impending AI regulations, but at the very least they don&#8217;t want open source developers deterred from their work.<\/p>\n<p>Dohmke said that the AI Act\u00a0can bring &#8220;the benefits of AI according to the European values and fundamental rights,&#8221; adding that lawmakers have a big part to play in achieving this.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is why I believe that the open source developers should be exempt from the AI act,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because ultimately this comes down to people. The open source community is not a community of entities. It&#8217;s a community of people and the compliance burden should fall on entities, it should fall on companies that are shipping products. OSS developers are often just volunteers, many of them are working two jobs. They are hobbyists and scientists, academics and doctors, professors and university students all alike, and they don&#8217;t usually stand to profit from their contributions. They certainly don&#8217;t have big budgets, or their own compliance department.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says that open source developers should be made exempt from the European Union&#8217;s (EU) proposed new artificial intelligence (AI) regulations, saying that the opportunity is still there for Europe to lead on AI. &#8220;Open source is forming the foundation of AI in Europe,&#8221;

These apps, which require physical access to someone&#8217;s phone, are known as stalkerware (or spouseware), as many are expressly advertised as a way of spying on a person&#8217;s spouse or partner. Others are sold <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/11\/google-pulls-stalkerware-ads-that-promoted-phone-spying-apps\/\">under the guise<\/a> of child monitoring software.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, New York attorney general Letitia James said that Hinchy used his consortium of companies for &#8220;aggressively promoting&#8221; his stalkerware apps. James&#8217; office also accused Hinchy\u2019s companies of failing to disclose that customers would <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/01\/hackers-unc0ver-jailbreak-iphone\/\">have to jailbreak<\/a> \u2014 or root \u2014 a victim&#8217;s device before they could plant the stalkerware, a process that can weaken the security of a person&#8217;s device.<\/p>\n<p>The agreement says that Hinchy must notify affected victims within 60 days that their device is being monitored. Hinchy must also make &#8220;accurate disclosures regarding endorsements, rooting and jailbreaking requirements, refund policies, and data security,&#8221; per James&#8217; office.<\/p>\n<p>But the agreement falls short of outlawing the apps completely.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/news\/press-releases\/2020\/03\/ftc-gives-final-approval-settlement-stalking-apps-developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned<\/a> Retina-X after it was hacked <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/3k7a5k\/hacker-wipes-spyware-retina-x-flexispy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several times<\/a>. A year later, the FTC also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/02\/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware\/\">banned<\/a> the stalkerware maker SpyFone and its parent company Support King from the surveillance industry. The FTC also instructed Support King to notify victims that their phones had been compromised.<\/p>\n<p>In December, TechCrunch reported that Support King had rebranded as a new stalkerware operation, SpyTrac, in an effort to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/17\/support-king-ftc-spytrac\/\">evade the FTC&#8217;s ban<\/a>. Following the publication of our investigation, both Support King and SpyTrac went offline.<\/p>\n<p>It is not yet known exactly how many users \u2014 or victims \u2014 were ensnared by PhoneSpector, Highster and the other stalkerware apps.

It&#8217;s also accusing Luka Inc, the developer behind the Replika app, of failing to fulfil regional legal requirements to clearly convey how it&#8217;s using people&#8217;s data.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.garanteprivacy.it\/web\/guest\/home\/docweb\/-\/docweb-display\/docweb\/9852214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">order<\/a> to stop processing Italians&#8217; data is effective immediately.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.garanteprivacy.it\/home\/docweb\/-\/docweb-display\/docweb\/9852506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release<\/a> announcing its intervention, the watchdog\u00a0said: &#8220;The AI-powered chatbot, which generates a \u2018virtual friend\u2019 using text and video interfaces, will not be able to process [the] personal data of Italian users for the time being. A provisional limitation on data processing was imposed by the Italian Garante on the U.S.-based company that has developed and operates the app; the limitation will take effect immediately.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Recent media reports along with tests the SA [supervisory authority] carried out on \u2018Replika\u2019 showed that the app carries factual risks to children &#8212; first and foremost, the fact that they are served replies which are absolutely inappropriate to their age,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n<p>Replika was an early API partner for OpenAI&#8217;s text-generating large language model technology, GPT-3 &#8212; although it&#8217;s service is not running on a carbon copy of GPT-3 (nor is it the same technology as OpenAI&#8217;s buzzy ChatGPT). Rather the startup claims it &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.replika.com\/posts\/building-a-compassionate-ai-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fine-tuned<\/a>&#8221; GPT-3, using a network machine learning model trained on dialogue, to hone the generative technology for its particular use-case: Conversational (and it claims &#8220;empathic&#8221;) AI companions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>However concerns have been raised before now about the risks the technology might pose to children &#8212; ranging from worries over kids being exposed to inappropriate content to more general concerns, that they might get addicted to the interactions or just be encouraged into spending lots of money on customizing their avatars or to gain access to other paid content. But the Italian watchdog appears to the first regulator to take formal action over child safety.<\/p>\n<p>The Garante&#8217;s order notes that several user reviews of the app report sexually inappropriate content being served up. It also notes that while the app is listed as 17+, on Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android app stores, the developer&#8217;s terms of service only prohibit use by under 13s. And while under 18s are required to obtain authorization from a parent or guardian, the watchdog points out the app does not seek to verify the age of users, nor block minors who provide information about their age &#8212; hence its\u00a0view that Replika is failing to protect children.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is actually no age verification mechanism in place: no gating mechanism for children, no blocking of the app if a user declares that they are underage. During account creation, the platform merely requests a user\u2019s name, email account and gender,&#8221; it observes. &#8220;And the \u2018replies\u2019 served by the chatbot are often clearly in conflict with the enhanced safeguards children and vulnerable individuals are entitled to. Several reviews on the two main App Stores include comments by users flagging sexually inappropriate contents.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;\u2018Replika\u2019 is in breach of the EU data protection regulation: It does not comply with transparency requirements and it processes personal data unlawfully since performance of a contract cannot be invoked as a legal basis, even implicitly, given that children are incapable to enter into a valid contract under Italian law,&#8221; the Garante added, saying it has ordered its U.S.-based developer to cease processing data relating to Italian users &#8212; giving it 20 days to communicate measures taken to comply with the order.<\/p>\n<p>Failure to comply with the order risks a fine of up to \u20ac20 million, or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, it further notes.<\/p>\n<p>Replika was contacted for a response to the Garante&#8217;s order.<\/p>\n<p>The EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a strong emphasis on safeguarding children&#8217;s information and privacy &#8212; suggesting, for example, that services which are likely to have minors as users should think about incorporating child friendly design and be pro-active about conducting risk assessments to ensure they spot potential safety and other rights issues.<\/p>\n<p>Watchdogs in the region have shown a willingness to pay attention to infringements in this area.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/05\/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy\/\">Last fall<\/a>, for example, Instagram was hit with a fine of nearly $440 million for breaching children&#8217;s privacy. Consumer protection authorities in Europe have also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/22\/tiktok-eu-consumer-protection-commtiments\/\">raised concerns over child safety on TikTok<\/a> &#8212; although <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/15\/ireland-probes-tiktoks-handling-of-kids-data-and-transfers-to-china\/\">an investigation of TikTok&#8217;s handling of children&#8217;s data<\/a> remains ongoing in Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>The Italian data protection watchdog has shown itself to be particularly sensitive to child safety concerns in recent years &#8212; using an emergency intervention, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/25\/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death\/\">two years ago<\/a>, to order TikTok to block users it could not age-verify in response after the death of a child who had been reported to have participated in a risky challenge on the platform. That led to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/12\/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users\/\">a purge of more than half a million accounts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, despite some enforcement of the GDPR (and consumer protection laws) around child safety issues, campaign groups have argued kids are still not being properly protected &#8212; and have continued pushing for tougher laws. So restrictions are only likely to get tighter.<\/p>\n<p>In the U.K., an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code\/\">age-appropriate design code<\/a> focused on protecting minors from safety and privacy risks came into force in fall 2021.

But gaining access to a sufficient amount of data is not a straightforward endeavor, given that data is often owned by organizations or individuals that might not want third-parties to have access to their data. Or, they may only make said data available under a commercial license, making it prohibitively expensive to harness.<\/p>\n<p>The U.K., as with other countries, has long had regulations around text and data mining, constituting part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copyright,_Designs_and_Patents_Act_1988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act<\/a> (1988). <a href=\"https:\/\/www.legislation.gov.uk\/ukpga\/1988\/48\/section\/29A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In 2014<\/a>, the U.K. tweaked these regulations to include an &#8220;exception&#8221; that would allow AI researchers to use third-party data more freely for non-commercial purposes. Notably, these new rules still prevented commercial entities from using such data, which is why the U.K. wanted to remove such restrictions as a means to encourage commercial AI development.<\/p>\n<p>After a two-month <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/artificial-intelligenceand-ip-consultation-on-copyright-and-patents-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consultation period<\/a> in 2021 that sought input from stakeholders including rightsholders, academics, lawyers, trade organisations and businesses, the U.K.\u2019s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) revealed back in June that it <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">would extend its existing exception far beyond the research and academia spheres, meaning that there would be no data mining opt-outs for rightsholders. In the months that followed, the music industry, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.publishers.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/PCF-TDM-Letter-as-of-080822.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">publishers<\/a> and other creative sectors voiced their concerns about what this might mean for copyrighted works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In response to these concerns, Julia Lopez, Member of Parliament (MP) and Minister of State for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure, <a href=\"https:\/\/committees.parliament.uk\/oralevidence\/11918\/pdf\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said<\/a> in November that the IPO had extended its consultation period, and that she was &#8220;fairly confident&#8221; that the plans would not proceed. Then last month, the House of Lords Communications Committee <a href=\"https:\/\/committees.parliament.uk\/committee\/170\/communications-and-digital-committee\/news\/175423\/dont-let-complacency-jeopardise-the-creative-industries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned the Government<\/a> about &#8220;undermining the U.K.\u2019s creative industries,&#8221; pointing to its \u00a3115 billion ($139 billion) pre-pandemic value.<\/p>\n<p>Now, following a <a href=\"https:\/\/hansard.parliament.uk\/Commons\/2023-02-01\/debates\/7CD1D4F9-7805-4CF0-9698-E28ECEFB7177\/ArtificialIntelligenceIntellectualPropertyRights#contribution-EC0C1848-75F0-4E42-B48B-60BD323CECFB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">parliamentary debate on Wednesday<\/a>, we have the clearest sign yet that the U.K. is set to roll-back its controversial plans.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2>Turmoil<\/h2>\n<p>Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation George Freeman has said that the proposals as originally set out &#8220;were not correct,&#8221; and that they didn&#8217;t factor in enough input during the consultation period before the proposals were announced.<\/p>\n<p>In response to one MP who asked what the current status was, Freeman said that &#8220;we will not be proceeding with the proposals,&#8221; though he stressed that it all still had to go through formal processes before this becomes official. Notably, Freeman poured scorn on his predecessors for greenlighting the proposals in the first place, while pointing to recent political &#8220;turmoil&#8221; in the U.K. as one reason this all came to pass in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think I could be clearer that the two Ministers concerned [Lopez and Freeman] agree that the proposals submitted, approved and published did not meet with the expected support,&#8221; Freeman said. &#8220;I hasten to say that they were published after I left Government, and it was a period of some turmoil. One of the lessons from this is to try not to legislate in periods of political turmoil.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Assuming that Freeman and Lopez&#8217;s recent remarks can be taken at face value, what this means is that the U.K. government will go back to the drawing board with all the internal and external stakeholders to devise a regulatory framework that both protects the creative industries, while also supporting the U.K.&#8217;s aspirations as an &#8220;AI superpower.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;AI is coming at us as a transformational technology at a pace that we have not had to deal with before in Government,&#8221; Freeman said. &#8220;The pace, the halving of technology cycles, and the speed at which it is maturing and reinventing itself are creating some big and interesting challenges for established industries, new industries that are taking shape and creators across all the different spheres of the creative industries.

It&#8217;s been streaming on Twitch since December, and until a few days ago, the stream had an average of about four concurrent viewers. Now, at the moment I write this, there are 15,097 people watching a group of badly animated friends &#8212; Larry Feinberg, Fred Kastopolous, Yvonne Torres and Zoltan Kalker &#8212; cycling through infinite &#8220;Seinfeld&#8221;-like scenes with very little plot.<\/p>\n<p>The show has been streaming almost non-stop on Twitch since December, but it only reached a wider audience this week, when its creators slowly started promoting the stream on Reddit. Now, &#8220;Nothing, Forever&#8221; has more than 98,000 followers on Twitch, and a Discord channel with about 6,000 members.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the project are Skyler Hartle, a senior product manager at Microsoft, and Brian Habersberger, a polymer physicist. They call themselves Mismatch Media, though this venture remains a side project.<\/p>\n<p>Aptly, the duo met online while playing &#8220;Team Fortress 2&#8221; and they kept in touch over time. Four years ago, they started working on creative projects together.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479650\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479650\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2479650\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png 1718w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=300,164 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=768,419 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=680,371 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=1536,839 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=1200,655 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2023-02-02-at-1.46.41-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479650\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/watchmeforever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nothing, Forever <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;It kind of started its journey as a kind of art project that Brian approached me with, and we ended up collaborating and working on it together and iterating on it over the last four years,&#8221; Hartle told TechCrunch. &#8220;The show we&#8217;re creating is really cool, and scratches that creative itch as just a surreal, fun kind of project, but we saw the merit of generative technology as a tool for broad-scale content creation and generation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To make &#8220;Nothing, Forever,&#8221; Hartle and Habersberger use various AI models to generate text, speech and movements. The &#8220;script&#8221; of the show comes from an OpenAI <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/\">GPT-3<\/a> model, Davinci. To voice the characters, they use the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services speech API, and the visuals are made on the Unity game engine.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Unity engine just does a lot of interpretation to basically run the show and inherit all this content, and the voices, and all these kinds of other pieces of direction from what we call &#8216;the director&#8217; in the cloud,&#8221; Hartle said. &#8220;And the director dictates what happens on the show from a generative perspective.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>They set out to create a surrealist, never-ending television show, and it simply made sense to base it on &#8220;Seinfeld,&#8221; a show that has defined the structure of a sitcom.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A sitcom has a laugh track and a sort of formulaic structure,&#8221; Habersberger told TechCrunch. &#8220;So when characters are saying things that don&#8217;t quite make sense, but the structure is one that you&#8217;re very familiar with, it really helps you to interpret and make sense of it, even though the sense isn&#8217;t there.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>AI dialogue can get repetitive. Characters are constantly referencing new restaurants and stores to the point that it&#8217;s become an in-joke.

When enough players got involved, the stream turned into chaos. (The route through Rock Tunnel is confusing enough, but imagine navigating it with thousands of people clamoring to control the character&#8217;s movement.)<\/p>\n<p>Yet over the two weeks it took to beat the game, fans built deep lore to explain why the character was behaving so erratically. No, we didn&#8217;t keep opening our bag to look at the Helix Fossil because of the chaotic button mashing in the chat; indeed, it was because our player character worshiped the Helix Fossil like a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitchplayswiki.fandom.com\/wiki\/Lord_Helix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the same vein, &#8220;Nothing, Forever&#8221; fans try to parse dialogue to learn more about the universe of the show. On Discord, fans requested a new channel to keep track of new lore as it develops; one page on the wiki chronicles what we know from past mentions of <a href=\"https:\/\/nothingforever.fandom.com\/wiki\/Aliens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aliens<\/a>. The community also keeps track of Larry&#8217;s recurring standup jokes, which are pretty bad (&#8220;What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear.&#8221;), but somehow get funnier the more they&#8217;re repeated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way that the chat is engaging, they&#8217;re kind of creating their own memes and their own culture,&#8221; said Hartle. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had people who have reached out wanting to be community mods and have been watching the show for eight hours at a time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Like &#8220;Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon,&#8221; the creators of &#8220;Nothing, Forever&#8221; hope to include audience participation features in the future. Hartle told TechCrunch that there are not currently any interactivity features embedded in the livestream, though some fans began theorizing that they were causing Larry to repeat his jokes by getting excited when he talked about gummy bears again.<\/p>\n<p>Mismatch Media hopes they can repurpose the tech stack behind &#8220;Nothing, Forever&#8221; into an actual system for creating generative media projects.

The companies that are in the most danger are the ones who don\u2019t have a clear path to profitability in the short or medium term. As access to capital has become more constrained, so has the appetite for growth at all costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, what resulted were announcements of companies buckling against the strain and being acquired or folding over the past year. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/commercialobserver.com\/2022\/06\/jokr-closing-u-s-operations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buyk, Fridge No More<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sf.eater.com\/2022\/3\/28\/23000037\/zero-grovery-delivery-startup-close-unpaid-bills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zero Grocery<\/a> ceased operations \u2014 with Zero doing so just weeks after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/03\/no-plastic-clamshells-here-zero-grocery-aims-to-eliminate-unnecessary-plastic-in-grocery-delivery\/\">announcing a new funding round<\/a>.

It\u2019s been growing, on average, 32% each year since 2019, and together, the market generated an estimated $3.1 billion in revenue in 2022. The market is expected to grow about 10% each year through 2027, which would effectively double the market, according to Ken Research.<\/p>\n<p>The market also has some fierce competition. Some of the big players serving the country include iFood, Rappi and Mercado Libre.

Binance has never managed or controlled WazirX\u2019s operations, including in relation to users\u2019 assets and user activity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Binance said it has &#8220;invited&#8221; Zanmai as an exception to work out arrangements with the firm to withdraw any remaining assets after February 3 but whether such arrangements will materialize &#8220;ultimately lies with the Zanmai team.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement late Friday, a WazirX spokesperson said the firm has initiated the process of transferring assets to multi-sig wallets, which it expects to be fully completed within the next few hours. &#8220;Users can continue to trade, deposit &amp; withdraw funds as usual. Your funds are safe with us,&#8221; the spokesperson added.<\/p>\n<p>Direct customers of Binance are not impacted by the dispute between the firms, Binance said.<\/p>\n<p>WazirX is one of the largest crypto exchanges in India. The firm processed over $10 billion worth of trades last year. Its dispute with Binance is only one of the headaches for the firm, which, like its local rivals CoinSwitch and CoinDCX, is also grappling with an increasingly hostile regulatory environment.<\/p>\n<p>India\u2019s tax rules on crypto, which went into effect last April, have resulted in local exchanges ceding the lion\u2019s share of the market to those operated by foreign players, according to a report. Binance, Coinbase and other foreign exchanges <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/03\/india-crypto-tax-pushing-traders-to-foreign-exchanges\/\">commanded 67.6% of the crypto market share in India<\/a> as of October 2022, up from 50% in November 2021, according to New Delhi-based think tank Esya.<\/p>\n<p>All Indian exchanges have also seen trading volume on their platforms &#8212; their marquee business line &#8212; dwindle amid the new tax regime and ongoing market downturn.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Binance will stop offering its wallet and other tech services that it provided to WazirX, escalating tension with the Indian crypto exchange that it once sought to acquire.

class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The EU will<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_22_7404\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invest \u20ac13.5 billion<\/a> in research and innovation for 2023-2024 as part of the Horizon Europe program. For the first time in the program&#8217;s history, it will include targeted support for Ukraine. This is one of the first real steps toward Ukraine&#8217;s integration with the EU and I can&#8217;t be happier that we are becoming a part of European business and science communities.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this an important sign? Ukraine has been defending itself from Russia for 11 months now. Uncertain times make investors think twice before putting their money on the line. So when such an organization scales back its rhetoric with action, it can sway hesitant minds.<\/p>\n<p>And if that&#8217;s not convincing enough, I&#8217;m going to share a few more reasons why the prospects of the Ukrainian tech sector aren&#8217;t as bleak as they may seem from the outside.<\/p>\n<h2>The Ukrainian tech sector is adaptable and export oriented<\/h2>\n<p>The Ukrainian IT sector gets most of its business from Europe and the United States. While it also serves domestic needs, the majority of the sector&#8217;s revenue is from exports.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last six years, export volume grew by 26.8% annually. In 2021, exports reached $6.9 billion, exceeding the forecast by $100 million, according to the National Bank of Ukraine. While it&#8217;s undeniable that the war shook up the country&#8217;s economy, the IT sector has weathered it better than most.<\/p>\n<p>Another factor contributing to the sector&#8217;s resilience is its ability to adapt to new challenges. Hybrid and remote work is a local staple and has been refined over the years. So when nearly three-fourths of IT companies had to relocate because of the invasion, they quickly resumed working at max efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>This experience in managing distributed teams also means that Ukrainian IT has no problems with expansions. In 2022, Ukrainian companies started going global. They opened offices in Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany and other EU countries. This let them not only bring the product closer to clients, it also further protected the sector from war&#8217;s aftershocks.<\/p>\n<p>According to the statistics on the first 10 months of 2022, Ukraine&#8217;s export of IT services grew by 9.9% from a year earlier and brought in more than $6 billion in revenue, more than $542 million the revenue generated in 2021. Exports of IT services remains one of the few areas that continue to thrive despite war, per Lviv IT Cluster research.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe experts are predicting the Ukrainian economy will bounce back and that the investment made today will bring dividends for years to come.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.startupbridge.eu\/report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study<\/a> conducted by the Polish-Ukrainian Startup Bridge team in partnership with the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the Ukrainian Startup Fund reveals that more than two-thirds of startups still operating in Ukraine are basing their business on the global market. About 12% of the surveyed companies closed down operations after the Russian invasion.<\/p>\n<p>In combination, these factors inoculate Ukrainian IT from the biggest problems of war. The loss of local markets and centralized office space managed to make only a slight dent in the sector&#8217;s health.<\/p>\n<h2>Ukrainian startups are the horse to bet on<\/h2>\n<p>The Ukrainian startup ecosystem has developed rapidly in the past few years. Up until 2018, there wasn&#8217;t a single unicorn from Ukraine. Today, there are at least six Ukrainian startups with a $1 billion valuation:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab<\/li>\n<li>Grammarly<\/li>\n<li>Genesis<\/li>\n<li>Bitfury<\/li>\n<li>People.ai<\/li>\n<li>Firefly Aerospace<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Grammarly is a highlight here. In 2021, dubbed the year of decacorns ($10+ billion valuation), Grammarly was the first Ukrainian startup to join the club.<\/p>\n<p>If one unicorn is a lucky chance and two is a coincidence, Ukraine&#8217;s ability to nurture six startups to $1 billion each in three years is certainly a trend \u2014 a trend that&#8217;s demonstrating the untapped potential of the Ukrainian IT sector that the war didn&#8217;t manage to slow down.<\/p>\n<p>Need more convincing? How about the fact that these startups have been looking to international markets from the very beginning.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/18ZRdeTdrViIaejLgs0DOQpgR3JgCnsEa\/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ukrainian Startup Ecosystem Report<\/a>, two-thirds of startups say they operate on the global market; 12% don&#8217;t operate in Ukraine at all; and 80% plan to be competitive in foreign markets.<\/p>\n<p>In sum, these numbers suggest that Ukrainian IT wants to have a heavy presence in Western markets, not by depending on luck, but by planning for the long term. They don&#8217;t want to bind themselves to fluctuations in domestic markets. Investing in such startups is only a bad plan if you&#8217;re hedging that the EU and U.S. will stop being lucrative markets.<\/p>\n<h2>Ukrainian tech talent has a rock-solid foundation and experience<\/h2>\n<p>Ukraine is a large center for the development of IT. Its talent pool approaches a total of 200,000 software developers. In 2022, a record number of students enrolled in IT-adjacent majors.<\/p>\n<p>The secret to success is a historic foundation nurtured by modern sensibilities.<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, you have Ukraine&#8217;s strong engineering and academic pedigree. The tech universities of Kyiv, Lviv and Kharkiv have been at the forefront of tech development for centuries. On the other, you have IT companies setting up bootcamps in said universities, scouting for talent and supporting students with equipment and practical internships.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Ukrainian alumni aren&#8217;t just well versed in the theory of software engineering. They graduate ready to code thanks to a refined mix of theory and practice.<\/p>\n<p>If you need stats to back up my claims of Ukraine&#8217;s talent being quality, then let&#8217;s turn to international accolades (<a href=\"https:\/\/escadra.com.ua\/it-rynok-ukrainy-v-cifrax.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N-iX report<\/a>):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ukraine is in the top 20 in the A.T. Kearney Services Location Index.<\/li>\n<li>GSA calls it the &#8220;Offshoring Destination of the Year.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Many Ukrainian companies are listed in IAOP&#8217;s Global Outsourcing 100 and Software 500, Inc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With the ever-growing demand for exceptional software engineers, Ukrainian academia and IT are prepared to deliver. Thanks to our expertise and ever-refined talent pipelines, the Ukrainian talent pool will only grow.<\/p>\n<h2>The indomitable spirit of Ukrainian people<\/h2>\n<p>We tend to think ourselves rational and believe only in things that we can quantify. I disagree with that statement. The ever-elusive human factor often can tell you more than spreadsheets.<\/p>\n<p>Consider that on February 24, 2022, all foreign experts prophesied that Ukraine would fall quickly. The numbers suggested that the Russian army was better equipped and had more people. Yet, 11 months in, Ukraine isn\u2019t just guarding what it can but fighting back.<\/p>\n<p>What does this have to do with the economy and investment prospects?<\/p>\n<p>The numbers predicted that the Ukrainian economy would drop by 32%-33% in 2022. Yet, because of the country\u2019s ability to adapt and overcome, these grim predictions were quickly overshadowed.<\/p>\n<p>Logic dictates that mass exodus would have caused a demographic and economic crisis. <a href=\"https:\/\/itukraine.org.ua\/en\/it-reports-do-it-like-ukraine.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Do IT Like Ukraine Research<\/a> has showcased that 81.5% of IT companies that relocated abroad still plan to return to Ukraine, and 5.6% of them are already in the process of returning. Some Ukrainians have already done so. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/opendatabot.ua\/analytics\/ukrainians-coming-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenDataBot statistics<\/a> (Ukrainian service for monitoring registration data, which provides complete information about a person or company in Ukraine), nearly 9.3 million Ukrainians have crossed the border since February, about 7.4 million have returned, and more are on the way back.<\/p>\n<p>These people are showing they are ready to work hard to rebuild their country.<\/p>\n<p>So when the EU included Ukraine in the Horizon program, it wasn&#8217;t just charity. The experts are predicting the Ukrainian economy will bounce back and that the investment made today will bring dividends for years to come.<\/p>\n<p>Ukraine needs but a helping hand to make that post-war rebound happen, so investors will find plenty of opportunities to invest and reap the benefits.<\/p>\n<p>History is happening before our eyes \u2014 let\u2019s be a part of it!<div

In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/gear\/nothing-phone-2-us-2023-release-carl-pei-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a recent interview<\/a>, founder Carl Pei noted that the country will be a prime target for the Nothing Phone (2) when it launches toward year\u2019s end.<\/p>\n<p>The company has little else to reveal about the forthcoming handset at the moment, but the executive noted that Nothing\u2019s earbuds served as a kind of trial balloon for potential stateside expansion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re really excited about the U.S. market because it&#8217;s a big country,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you look at our earbuds sales, about one-third comes from the U.S. And by not launching our phone in the U.S., we&#8217;re leaving potentially a third of the volume on the table.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nothing confirmed that it is planning a non-beta U.S. release for its forthcoming handset. &#8220;The U.S. is a major priority for 2023,&#8221; Pei told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve assembled a team that I&#8217;m confident can deliver a fast and smooth OS experience currently missing in today&#8217;s smartphone industry. With the launch of our next flagship device later this year, I anticipate Nothing will not only fill in the gaps of what&#8217;s missing, but offer consumers real choice in a sea of sameness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The broader question is whether the lull in the market will serve as a net positive or negative for Nothing\u2019s ambitions. The slowdown may have created openings in a long-saturated category, but it remains to be seen whether the slowdown is temporary, or the beginning, or if consumers are done buying phones at their former rate. Economic factors ebb and flow, but even prior to the current climate, things were looking listless for smartphone manufacturers.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Hoping to continue the conversation later this month at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It there\u2019s one thing Nothing\u2019s first phone excelled at, it was bringing a bit of excitement to the staid world of smartphones.

The search giant said during its latest earnings call that YouTube Shorts has crossed 50 billion daily views. The company previously reported 30 billion daily views as part of its Q1 2022 earnings.<\/p>\n<p>While the growth performance is impressive, the number of views on Shorts lags on Instagram and Facebook. Last October, Meta <a href=\"https:\/\/s21.q4cdn.com\/399680738\/files\/doc_financials\/2022\/q3\/Meta-Q3-2022-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said<\/a> that Reels garnered 140 billion daily views across both social networks.<\/p>\n<p>Just like other platforms, YouTube has been pushing users to view Shorts. In November, the company rolled out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/07\/youtube-begins-rolling-out-shorts-on-tv-globally-starting-today\/\">Shorts on TV<\/a>. TikTok made a similar attempt to make <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/22\/tiktok-brings-its-tv-app-to-more-devices-across-the-u-s-and-canada\/\">its app available for multiple big-screened<\/a> platforms, including Amazon Fire TV, Android TV and select LG and Samsung smart TVs in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, YouTube said <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/15\/youtube-shorts-tops-1-5b-logged-in-users-monthly-users-touted-as-feeder-to-long-form-content\/\">1.5 billion logged-in users watch Shorts every month<\/a>. In 2021, TikTok said it crossed <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/27\/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users\/\">the mark of 1 billion monthly active users<\/a>. In comparison, Instagram has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-10-26\/meta-s-instagram-users-reach-2-billion-closing-in-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 2 billion users<\/a>. The company has not revealed how many of those watch Reels \u2014 though it is hard to escape short videos if you log into Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Growing short video views is good news for Google but it will need to monetize those views as well. In Q4 2022, YouTube banked $7.96 billion in revenue \u2014 down 8% from last year&#8217;s $8.63 billion. In November 2022, the company said <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/09\/youtube-music-and-premium-top-80-million-paid-subscribers\/\">YouTube Music and Premium had more than 80 million subscribers<\/a> worldwide. But it didn&#8217;t specify how much subscriptions contribute to YouTube&#8217;s revenue.<\/p>\n<p>On February 1, YouTube kicked off a new program to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/09\/youtube-new-partner-program-terms-shorts-revenue-sharing-february-1\/\">share ad revenue with Shorts creators<\/a>. That could incentivize more creators to make original content for the platform.

In 2018, he co-founded Aspire, a solar installation company based on the knowledge he acquired in college on renewable energy and working in several roles relating to energy, gas and power projects across Nigeria and other African countries, including a five-year stint at Siemens as head of market development. Though this business morphed into SunFi three years later, launching Aspire was the first of a lifelong journey that Thomas had envisioned in trying to fix the electricity issues individuals and businesses face in Nigeria, he said on the call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nigerian households and businesses have little or no access to affordable and reliable solar technology, which reduces their reliance on grid-based power that suffers from insufficient generation capacity and fails to serve most of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people who live in rural areas. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning to off-grid solutions that use solar energy is an option for these people who need electricity for simple necessities like lighting, heating and communication. And that\u2019s what Rotimi\u2019s previous upstart did. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/aspirepowersolutions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aspire<\/a> ran a power-as-a-service business model that helped install more than 500 solar systems for individuals and businesses. But despite being marketed as a cheap option, rural electrification in the form of microgrids and solar systems can be expensive to these sub-consumers because of their low spending power.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCustomers would always ask us if there was a way for them to pay for the solar systems in installments,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBecause of that, we went to the banks and tried to work with them to finance this kind of payment, but we realized that banks also had a problem: they couldn\u2019t dash out credit to customers to finance retail solar systems when they didn\u2019t understand the technical risks involved in owning them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further market research revealed that other solar providers faced the same issue of customers requesting to pay in installments. Thomas and his co-founders &#8212; COO<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tomigun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Tomiwa Igun<\/a> and CTO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/gofaniyi\/?originalSubdomain=ng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Olaoluwa Faniyi<\/a> &#8212; decided to provide credit and began leasing these systems in what later became SunFi. They believed that as an outfit, they could manage the technical risk involved with solar systems and that it was highly likely that customers would pay because they valued solar systems and saw them as critical pieces of power infrastructure. <\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about it. Retail solar systems are marketed via word of mouth, but with distribution being fragmented and minimal avenues to provide financing, platforms like SunFi that act as aggregators become appealing to customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe challenge customers face with solar providers is that they want solutions they can pay small for; however, these solar platforms can\u2019t offer. Because banks are afraid of the technical risk involved, they need something in between to talk with good solar providers and do the installation work while providing good capital to customers looking for the right solution. We\u2019re the guys in the middle of all this,\u201d Thomas said.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"myX2kUPPBi\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/26\/kenyas-growth-was-strongest-in-africas-vc-market-clean-tech-e-commerce-pulled-in-most-of-the-funding\/\">Kenya&#8217;s growth was strongest in Africa&#8217;s VC market; clean tech, e-commerce pulled in most of the funding<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kenya&#8217;s growth was strongest in Africa&#8217;s VC market; clean tech, e-commerce pulled in most of the funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/26\/kenyas-growth-was-strongest-in-africas-vc-market-clean-tech-e-commerce-pulled-in-most-of-the-funding\/embed\/#?secret=0R5vhVfwEm#?secret=myX2kUPPBi\" data-secret=\"myX2kUPPBi\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFi creates value for these clean energy investors by de-risking the technical and credit risk involved in financing portfolios of solar solutions, opening avenues for lending as a service play for clean energy providers. Since its official launch last February, SunFi has onboarded over 40 solar system vendors to its platform at various stages of vetting; 10 are its core providers, which have served more than 129 customers. Within the past year, the one-year-old energy startup has deployed more than $600,000 to these customers via its partnerships with financial institutions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nigeria-based energy company provides customers with two payment methods: a lease to own, where after an initial deposit, customers make payments in installments before owing the solar system, and a subscription model, where customers pay to use the solar system monthly. SunFi\u2019s revenues are from the margin on the lease-to-own model and subscription fees from the latter. The company said it is working on a third revenue stream where it will assist solar providers with inventory financing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some startups already finance solar systems with one or multiple entities, such as Carbon. But Thomas doesn\u2019t regard them as competitors; the same goes for solar system providers. Instead, most of these platforms are partners since they already fill a need in the market and SunFi\u2019s job aggregates them. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBecause we have a unique experience having been a solar provider initially and seeing the frustration and challenges of installations in Nigeria, we\u2019ve taken all that technical and credit knowledge to build a system that hopefully works for customers, solar providers and banks,\u201d said the chief executive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSunFi also has a portal for the solar provider to log in, track and manage their business of building several types of products to market to customers and get access to financing. Investors have their dashboard to manage their portal to track how their money is spent in terms of being deployed to manage portfolios or retail customers. So we\u2019re built as a fintech for the clean tech space, which doesn\u2019t exist in Nigeria.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479710\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479710\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2479710 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"SunFi\" width=\"680\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg 990w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg?resize=150,67 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg?resize=300,135 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg?resize=768,344 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg?resize=680,305 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/F80B72E9-AF45-4752-8270-E3EC403BBA02.jpeg?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479710\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The SunFi team. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> SunFi<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The clean tech with fintech features will be looking to enhance its platform over the next 12-18 months with this financing.

Users without a Twitter Blue subscription can access the Spaces tab already but it mostly shows which live audio sessions are currently going on.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is also bringing back themed stations that list Spaces stations by topic. The company<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/03\/twitter-to-revamp-spaces-tests-themed-stations-and-a-daily-digest\/\"> already started testing it in August<\/a> before Elon Musk took over.

Now, the social network might be relying on algorithms to group related real-time audio conversations together.<\/p>\n<p>The social network is making podcasts available only to Blue subscribers and &#8220;some people on Twitter for iOS and Twitter for Android apps.&#8221; Podcasts were also integrated into <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/25\/twitter-is-officially-adding-podcasts-to-its-platform\/\">Twitter in the pre-Musk era<\/a>, but the company seems to be resuming work on some of those projects. Twitter said that at the beginning, there will be no way to search for podcasts. So you will have to listen to whatever the algorithm serves you.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter Blue&#8217;s expansion is not surprising as the company aims to bring more revenue in all ways possible.

On Thursday, Twitter announced that it is discontinuing free access to its API and will roll out a basic paid plan next week. While the company didn&#8217;t declare the price tag, Elon Musk tweeted that basic plans <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1621259936524300289\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">might cost $100 a month<\/a> \u2014 which could be steep for some independent developers, students and researchers.<\/p>\n<p>While the company has registered declining ad revenue, the good news for Musk is that plenty of companies, including PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch InBev, have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/musks-twitter-scores-super-bowl-deals-a-boon-for-struggling-ad-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly committed millions of dollars for Super Bowl takeover ads on Twitter<\/a>.

That made Damus&#8217; approval process difficult at first, as Apple requires services to have a mechanism for flagging objectional content, but Damus eventually worked out a way to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/damus-another-decentralized-social-networking-app-arrives-to-take-on-twitter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get listed in Apple&#8217;s App Store on February 1<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The decentralized nature of the app no doubt led to its short-lived debut in China, where information is under tight control by the government. Social networks legally operating in China all have censorship tools baked in to eliminate illegal content or information banned by the authority. Anonymity is non-existent as user signups are linked to people&#8217;s real identities.<\/p>\n<p>The authority has cut off Damus&#8217; distribution in the country through App Store. But it looks like access is so far intact. Those already with Damus on their phones can still view and comment on posts without having to circumvent the Great Firewall, the country&#8217;s censorship system that blocks or slows down certain foreign websites, as of February 3.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Nostr is built to be censorship-resistant through &#8220;relays,&#8221; a type of network responsible for receiving posts and distributing them to network participants. Users can publish their posts to multiple relays, and they only see content in the relays they connect to. So if one relay is censored, they can post their content through another. But having competing networks also undermines the platform&#8217;s network effects, meaning Damus isn&#8217;t really an ideal Twitter replacement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more like a news group, interest group or fans club kind of thing,&#8221; says Frank Hu, COO at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bytetradelab.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ByteTrade Lab<\/a>, a web3 infrastructure startup backed by SIG Asia Venture Capital Fund.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Users can choose relays and need to obey the codes there. Relays compete and relay owners also compete. Based on this competition, builders can build different communities &#8212; paid or free, censored or censorship-free, targeting fans of influencers or pornstars.

Following the company&#8217;s announcement, shares of Getaround spiked 17% after hours from $0.64 at market close to $0.75, but have since settled to around $0.65, which is still a 2.19% increase today.<\/p>\n<p>Getaround, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/09\/getaround-braves-chilly-public-markets-with-spac-combination\/\">joined the public markets<\/a> in December via a merger with InterPrivate II Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), said it would also significantly reduce other operating expenses like the company&#8217;s contract workforce and outside professional services.<\/p>\n<p>Like almost every other executive over the past year who has ordered layoffs, Sam Zaid, Getaround&#8217;s CEO, said the restructuring plan is a response to &#8220;an uncertain near-term macroeconomic outlook, which has hit technology companies particularly hard.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Getaround expects the restructuring to result in cost savings of between $25 million and $30 million on an annualized run-rate basis.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how the company&#8217;s decision to go public through a SPAC merger has affected its balance sheets. The deal was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022, and Getaround has yet to set a date for its earnings release. Regulatory filings show Getaround&#8217;s cash burn in the first nine months of 2022 was $63.2 million. The company reported $45 million in revenue for the same period, which is a decrease from $48 million the year prior. By the end of Q3, Getaround had $27.2 million in cash to play around with.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The merger would have brought the company another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20221209005329\/en\/Getaround-Announces-Closing-of-Business-Combination-with-InterPrivate-II-Acquisition-Corp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$228 million of gross proceeds<\/a> to stay in operation and achieve its next phase of growth.

Farley said 2023 would be pivotal for the automaker. The company&#8217;s reorganization, which kicked off in March 2022, was designed to give the 118-year-old Michigan automaker the speed of a startup. It also shifted how it viewed earnings opportunities, saying it expected EVs to account for 50% of its global sales by 2030, up from 40% under previous guidance. The operating profit margin is expected to increase to 10% by 2026, up from 8%.<\/p>\n<p>There were a few costly expenses that also put a dent in Ford&#8217;s bottom line. The company&#8217;s stake in Rivian, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/09\/rivian-shares-down-more-than-17-following-report-of-ford-sell-off\/\">been steadily shrinking<\/a> since May 2022, has been costly. Ford reported it took a $7.3 billion writedown on its Rivian investment.<\/p>\n<p>It also wrote down $2.8 billion for its investment in Argo AI, the autonomous vehicle startup that Ford backed in 2017. Argo <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/26\/ford-vw-backed-argo-ai-is-shutting-down\/\">shut down<\/a> last fall after Ford and VW, its two investors and customers, pulled their support.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2>Breakdown of the numbers<\/h2>\n<p>Ford generated $44 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 17% from the $37.7 billion in revenue it reported in the same period last year.

Ford&#8217;s net income on an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2021 was $10 billion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ford\/\">Ford<\/a> had issued guidance that it would earn full-year guidance of adjusted earnings basis between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion. That&#8217;s a miss of $1.1 billion for the year.<\/p>\n<p>Ford said operating cash flow for the year was $6.9 billion and full-year adjusted free cash flow was $9.1 billion. The company reported that as of the end of 2022, it had $32 billion in cash on hand.<\/p>\n<p>Company executives, namely CFO John Lawler and Farley, emphasized that demand for Ford products and its reorganization puts the company in a position to correct its missteps in 2022. But the pair also cautioned that headwinds may remain in 2023, including a mild recession in the U.S. and moderate recession in Europe along with other economic trends such as a continued strong U.S. dollar.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Ford pointed to higher industrywide customer incentives as vehicle supply-and-demand rebalances; a lower profit. That&#8217;s code for discounting vehicles, which is already underway.<\/p>\n<p>In January, Ford increased production and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/30\/ford-discounts-its-all-electric-mustang-mach-e-in-response-to-teslas-ev-price-war\/\">cut the price<\/a> of its all-electric Mustang Mach-E crossover between about 1% to 8.8%, depending on the trim level.

In the report, CrowdStrike notes that it has limited visibility into the hacking campaign given that it has no \u201cadditional forensic artifacts,\u201d referring to data it obtained directly from targeted organizations. That\u2019s why the company admits it has \u201clow confidence\u201d in its assessment that this is activity by Scattered Spider.<\/p>\n<p>Two cybersecurity insiders, who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the press, said that the understanding within the industry is that Scattered Spider is the same group as 0ktapus.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cScattered Spider continued deploying numerous phishing pages in January 2023.

TaskUs, a contractor that provides customer service for companies, including Mailchimp, Intuit and other tech giants, was also on the list.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In January, Mailchimp <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/18\/mailchimp-hacked\/\">disclosed that it had been hacked<\/a> \u2014 the second hack against the company in six months. At the time, Mailchimp said the hackers targeted its employees via phishing. It\u2019s unclear if this incident is tied to the activities of Scattered Spider. Mailchimp did not respond to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>Riot declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Salesforce spokesperson Allen Tsai said that the company is &#8220;aware of and monitor phishing campaigns industry-wide.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At this time, we have no indication of unauthorized access to customer data relevant to the cited report,&#8221; Tsai said in an email.<\/p>\n<p>An Intuit spokesperson did not comment as they had not seen the report.<\/p>\n<p>Roblox, Zynga, TaskUs, Comcast and Grubhub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>The report said that \u201cthe majority\u201d of the hacking group\u2019s phishing pages were designed to mimic Okta login portals, \u201cwhile a much smaller number impersonated Microsoft.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CrowdStrike did not respond to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>Are you a Google Fi subscriber that was also a victim of a similar attack?

Recently discovered code snippets reference explicitly refer to a &#8220;paid blue badge&#8221; and a new subscription product, a developer has discovered. The same reference also appears in the latest build of the Facebook app, indicating paid verification could be offered across Meta&#8217;s platforms if the product continued to be developed.<\/p>\n<p>The discovery was made by developer and reverse engineer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex193a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alessandro Paluzzi,<\/a> who has previously spotted a number of new Instagram features before they launched, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/08\/instagram-scheduling-tool-all-professional-accounts\/?guccounter=2&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9haW4udWEv&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALqUj2XiZbyUdQQRDkhXU1IdG9UWBLz_LC8DVIaL0s9THLr-zsBWS_Azv7Fdcaz224-hu_gO6sLmfGqMm4B4kVhz4ab0RfdrNHWEQDUOM3GTLuq5Dfp3dO9Bckw5GwabRtmxwqNR42RPUh-2zomlMotOZzMnzOvvRLLElkyDL6eK#!\">in-app scheduling tool<\/a> that launched in November and the newer <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/25\/instagram-is-now-allowing-users-to-share-posts-reels-and-locations-through-qr-codes\/?_guc_consent_skip=1661436636#!\">QR code sharing features<\/a>. He&#8217;s also regularly spotted other internal prototypes, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/23\/instagrams-latest-feature-test-is-about-being-bereal\/#!\">Instagram&#8217;s Candid Challenges<\/a> and features in development with Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, Instagram confirms its smaller tests or prototypes when discovered, but in the case of the paid verification option, the company chose not to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Given Paluzzi&#8217;s track record, however, it&#8217;s worth at least speculating why Instagram could be weighing a decision around paid verification.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, Paluzzi shared with TechCrunch screenshots in the app&#8217;s code that included lines referencing &#8220;IG_NME_PAID_BLUE_BADGE_IDV&#8221; and &#8220;FB_NME_PAID_BLUE_BADGE_IDV.&#8221; He suggested that, given the context, &#8220;IDV&#8221; could mean identity verification &#8212; as that&#8217;s also <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.namescan.io\/knowledgebase\/identity-verification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a known<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/withpersona.com\/blog\/what-is-identity-verification-idv-and-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meaning<\/a> for the acronym.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479539\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479539\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2479539\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg 888w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=768,292 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=680,259 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex193a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">code screenshots from Alessandro Paluzzi <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In addition, the developer told us he found other references to a new type of subscription product that hadn&#8217;t been there previously.

Although Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/28\/instagram-how-to-get-verified\/\">in 2018 began allowing users<\/a> to request verification, the overall system itself hasn&#8217;t changed much, despite Instagram head <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mosseri\/status\/1272592295792013313\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam Mosseri&#8217;s promise<\/a> that account verification would be a focus of improvement back in 2020.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FivYZI473C\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/28\/instagram-how-to-get-verified\/\">You can now apply to get a verified badge on Instagram \u2014 here&#8217;s how<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now apply to get a verified badge on Instagram \u2014 here&#8217;s how&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/28\/instagram-how-to-get-verified\/embed\/#?secret=bMdIwjiHYR#?secret=FivYZI473C\" data-secret=\"FivYZI473C\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Currently, the coveted blue badge is still only awarded to high-profile individuals, celebrities, and global brands or entities. But everyday users and smaller creators have long sought similar recognition. That&#8217;s led to <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/instagram-verification-paid-black-market-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a multimillion-dollar shadow market<\/a> for verification where people pay thousands of dollars for the blue badges through backchannel means. Last year, in fact, a ProPublica investigation revealed one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.propublica.org\/article\/instagram-spotify-verified-fake-musicians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest Instagram verification schemes<\/a> to date, which resulted in Meta having to remove illicitly gained badges from hundreds of accounts. In other words, there&#8217;s clearly demand for paid verification.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s something Elon Musk believes as well, as he quickly made paid verification a key selling point for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/25\/elon-musk-says-twitters-new-multicoloured-verification-will-launch-next-week\/\">Twitter&#8217;s revamped Twitter Blue subscription<\/a>. Unfortunately, Twitter&#8217;s implementation was not well thought out, leading to widespread impersonation on the network as users changed their names and profile photos to well-known individuals or brands, which then <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/09\/fake-twitter-blue-check-lebron-musk\/\">caused serious mischief<\/a>. Twitter had to almost immediately pause paid verification and retool, ultimately <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/11\/twitter-blue-to-relaunch-with-actual-verification-process-higher-price-for-apple-users\/\">relaunching<\/a> with gold badges for businesses and additional verification steps.<\/p>\n<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s initial attempts to monetize verification were chaotic, that doesn&#8217;t mean the idea itself has no value. Plus, advances in AI could help improve the verification process. Already, Instagram uses AI in other parts of its app &#8212; like finding which accounts <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/30\/instagram-will-require-users-to-provide-their-birthday\/\">belong to kids who lied about their age<\/a> as well as content recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Twitter isn&#8217;t the only major social app testing consumer demand for paid subscriptions. Snapchat also caters to its power users with a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/29\/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month\/\">Snapchat+ subscription<\/a> that offers a laundry list of perks and extra features. During this week&#8217;s earnings call, the company announced it had grown Snapchat+ to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/snapchat-now-has-more-than-2-million-paid-subscribers\/\">over 2 million subscribers<\/a> in just over half a year&#8217;s time.<\/p>\n<p>If it chose, Instagram could offer a subscription bundle to its own power users, which could include a paid blue badge and other features. While it&#8217;s not clear at the time that&#8217;s what it has in the works, it would be interesting to see such a product come to fruition.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com or 415.234.3994 on Signal.\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New references in Instagram&#8217;s code suggest the company could be developing a paid verification feature following the rollout of a similar system at Twitter under Elon Musk.

When you\u2019re new talent, you\u2019re at a lower rate, obviously. Sometimes you\u2019re more creative and willing to do a little more than what the job is, because you don\u2019t know what the job is.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Prior to the downturn, were students more excited to go into the world of Big Tech or startups?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was mixed. I really depended on whether they [had a] bachelor&#8217;s or a master&#8217;s. I found that a lot of students, if they were going to go into the startup world, it would be with a mature startup. It wasn\u2019t one that was just a year or two out. It was one that had at least a Series A. [\u2026] Now I think there\u2019s more of a focus on, \u2018Let\u2019s go with a large, more established company, just because they\u2019ll last.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now robotics is something that touches every other category, so there are a lot of robotics jobs to be had outside of strictly robotics companies.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Correct. I consider self-driving cars to be robotics. It\u2019s everything. You have control systems, you have autonomy, you have interaction with people. It\u2019s a classic robotics system that just happens to have a car form factor. Even in that domain, you saw a lot of startups close down, but the large companies have invested a lot more into that and EVs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What can schools do to train students for the job market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At Ohio State, we have instituted some programs within the last year around entrepreneurism in startups, around very specific areas. For example, manufacturing, healthcare. Things that we know we\u2019ll always need innovation in. Large companies need that entrepreneurial thinking and mindset, because it allows them to innovate within the company structure. When companies don\u2019t innovate, they tend to be archaic, and when the startup culture comes back up, they\u2019re gonna eat their corn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As far as your own experience running a startup, how did you determine when to hire a student versus someone more senior?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the technical talent, it was really new hires. It was because I needed fresh ideas. We needed to know the latest and the greatest, and they would have the education. For marketing and sales, that was much more established. We hired much more seasoned individuals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What tips would you give for startups hiring recent grads?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t put them on a critical path, starting off, because you might be disappointed if they don\u2019t rise to the challenge. But do give them things that require them to push the boundary conditions. If you hire them for front-end development or graphics, think about things that are tangential that I can push them in so that they can learn. [\u2026] You, as a manager, have to be much more strategic, and you have to lay it out.<\/p>\n<p>You do still have to do a little hand-holding. I don\u2019t want to call it &#8220;micromanagement,&#8221; but you do have to set deliverables, set milestones, and if they don\u2019t meet it, go back and ask them why they didn\u2019t meet it. Not reprimanding, but asking why. Sometimes what you\u2019ll find is they\u2019ll get stuck in certain areas you didn\u2019t anticipate, and then you can push them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I tend to think generational warfare is silly, but what would you say to those people who suggest that younger millennials and Gen Z are too sensitive or don\u2019t have a work ethic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think their motivation is different. The work ethic versus the too sensitive \u2014 this generation is passionate about certain things. They are impassionate about others. When you find what they\u2019re passionate about, whatever it is \u2014 social impact or design software for underserved communities \u2014 you get them there and they will work throughout the night. When we think about work ethic, it&#8217;s &#8220;You\u2019ve got to show up to work every day.&#8221; But if they\u2019re not interested, they can be a little slower or not responsive. It\u2019s a different type of work ethic.<\/p>\n<h2>Job Openings<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2157953\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2157953\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2157953 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a person talking to two colleagues via videoconferencing.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg 6250w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2157953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Getty Images \/ Olga Strelnikova<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sense of helplessness associated with economic downturns. It\u2019s the knowledge that \u2014 in the long run \u2014 no one\u2019s job is truly safe. The way we\u2019ve structured society means the farther down the ladder you are in regards to money and seniority, the more you\u2019re regarded as being expendable.<\/p>\n<p>For those who\u2019ve been spared, there\u2019s little consolation in a corporation\u2019s pledge to be more scrappy and return to its long-dormant startup roots when you\u2019ve seen so many colleagues suddenly out of work. For those of us who\u2019ve been through that experience, it\u2019s clear that corporate layoffs are indiscriminate when it comes to the individual. When push comes to shove, we all become rounding errors.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of positive feedback on social media reiterating the fact that layoffs aren\u2019t personal. Certainly that\u2019s true for the company doing the laying off, but it\u2019s quite the opposite for the people on the receiving end. Layoffs are deeply personal. They disrupt our lives, our livelihoods, our motivations, our relationships. They contribute to depression and a laundry list of different conditions.<\/p>\n<p>As someone who\u2019s been working in the world of publishing for a long time now, I\u2019ve been on the receiving end a few times. I understand that you can tell someone that something isn\u2019t their fault a million times over, but it can feel like a platitude. Moral support is extremely important during the process \u2014 but so are actionable items. Help good people find good jobs. We talk a lot about how work shouldn\u2019t define you, but it takes up more waking hours than anything else. People should be able to find work that is fulfilling and makes them feel valued.<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like you to take away from this, it\u2019s the fact that people are hurting. If you can help, help. Simple, I know, but if you need a less altruistic motivator, understand that the people you help now may well be in a position to help you later.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m hoping we can use Actuator as a platform to do just that. As I mentioned previously, each week I\u2019m going to feature a handful of companies in the robotics space that are hiring. I don\u2019t have a timeline for how long we\u2019ll be running this \u2014 a lot of that depends on the level of interest among job seekers. The plan for the moment, however, is to keep this going during the current downturn.<\/p>\n<p>I learned a long time ago that hiring is a key reason companies seek out coverage at a place like TechCrunch, and I understand that Actuator\u2019s readers are precisely the sort of people these organizations are looking for. We\u2019re not becoming a job board and won\u2019t post individual positions, but hopefully curating a list will prove useful for job seekers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to be included, shoot me a line with your company\u2019s name and how many positions you\u2019re hiring for (if you don\u2019t include the number, I will attempt to count).

It shows that yes, this company is small and finding its feet, but it&#8217;s also making real, measurable progress.<\/p>\n<p>Almost as important as the numbers themselves are <em>which<\/em> numbers the company is measuring. It shows monthly and daily active users (MAU\/DAU), which are crucial metrics to see how sticky an app is. It shows the number of teachers <em>and<\/em> how long they are staying on the platform, which again speaks to stickiness and the reach the company has. It talks about active user engagement, which shows that people are using the app actively.<\/p>\n<p>For perfect marks, I&#8217;d love to have seen these numbers as graphs rather than just as collated numbers. I&#8217;d also have liked to see dollar figures here. It&#8217;s great that there are 200+ paying subscribers, and that&#8217;s impressive for a pre-funding company. But even though the revenue numbers probably are very small, seeing a graph of those, too, is important. If you don&#8217;t put it on the slide, the investor will be suspicious about why and ask for it anyway \u2014 you may as well skip that conversation and give &#8217;em what they need right off the bat.<\/p>\n<p>The thing you can learn from this slide as a startup is to be deeply aware of the metrics that are going to help you build and deliver your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Business model front and center<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2477186\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2477186\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2477186\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2477186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Slide 14] It&#8217;s always a good idea to show that you <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/10\/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business\/\">understand the levers in your business<\/a>. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Laoshi<\/p><\/div>Gotta say, I don&#8217;t love the dark-gray-on-light-gray design, and it&#8217;s curious to me that this is in the appendix rather than in the core deck. As an investor, I think this would be one of the more important slides. I&#8217;d love to see where the business is now, as well. For example, when the company says its TAC (tutor acquisition cost) is $50, what is it actually seeing as its TAC right now? If it assumes that each tutor has five students, how is that showing up in practice?<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, these numbers are super important in your conversations with your investors; essentially, you&#8217;re showing how you are thinking about your business and your market and that you understand the levers in your business. In other words: What if every tutor had 10 students instead of five? What if every tutor cost $100 to acquire instead of $50? By plugging all of that into a model and running experiments to increase your trust in the model, you can get a long way toward building a great picture of your business in numbers.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uZrz8dmeZE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/10\/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business\/\">How to understand the financial levers in your business<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to understand the financial levers in your business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/10\/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business\/embed\/#?secret=tVdedsvzt2#?secret=uZrz8dmeZE\" data-secret=\"uZrz8dmeZE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In the rest of this teardown, we\u2019ll take a look at three things Laoshi could have improved or done differently, along with the company&#8217;s full pitch deck!<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Laoshi raised $570,000 for its very early-stage language-learning app targeted at Chinese tutors and their students.

CEO Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan says that the cash infusion &#8212; Samooha&#8217;s first &#8212; will be put toward product development and hiring; the plan is to grow the startup&#8217;s team from 14 developers to roughly 20 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>So, you might be wondering, what exactly does Samooha do? In brief, the platform lets businesses securely share, collaborate on and gain insights from their and their partners&#8217; data, regardless of the underlying cloud and data stack.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a new concept. &#8220;Data clean rooms&#8221; have been around for a while, pitched both by tech giants and startups as the ideal solution for sharing sensitive data across computing environments. Just a few years ago, Harbr <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/16\/harbr-raises-38-5m-to-help-enterprises-exchange-and-share-big-data-troves-securely\/\">raised<\/a> $38.5 million for its tech to help enterprises securely exchange and share big data troves. InfoSum and Decentriq also offer secure data-sharing tools, while Amazon Web Services recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/29\/aws-gets-data-clean-rooms-for-analytics-data\/\">launched<\/a> a new data clean room product &#8212; called Clean Rooms, appropriately &#8212; aimed at organizations that regularly share data with outside partners.<\/p>\n<p>To the extent Samooha&#8217;s differentiated, it leans heavily on the Snowflake ecosystem &#8212; which isn&#8217;t exactly surprising given Snowflake&#8217;s involvement in the startup&#8217;s fundraising. A native app on Snowflake, Samooha provides a no-code UI customers can use to access and build clean room apps. The underlying trust boundary of Snowflake&#8217;s native apps framework provides the secure computation environment, Sivaramakrishnan explained in an interview with TechCrunch, while <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">eliminating the need for any data migration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479491\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479491\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2479491\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp\" alt=\"Samooh\" width=\"1024\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp 1236w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=300,184 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=768,472 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=680,418 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=1200,738 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Samooha<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Security guarantees are enforced both technically via cryptographic multi-party computation technologies and with user-defined policies like approved query templates.

But most businesses have an incomplete view of customer and consumer data,&#8221; Sivaramakrishnan said. &#8220;The pandemic shone light on the need for data collaboration in a safe, secure fashion across multiple industries, be that healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain and logistics, and more\u00a0 . . .
